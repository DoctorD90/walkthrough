# It's possible to use use apt-cacher-ng as a regular web server with a limited
# feature set, i.e. directory browsing, downloads of any files, Content-Type
# based on /etc/mime.types, but without sorting, CGI execution, index page
# redirection and other funny things.
# To get this behavior, mappings between virtual directories and real
# directories on the server must be defined with the LocalDirs directive.
# Virtual and real directories are separated by spaces, multiple pairs are
# separated by semi-colons. Real directories must be absolute paths.
# NOTE: Since the names of that key directories share the same namespace as
# repository names (see Remap-...) it is administrator's job to avoid conflicts
# between them or explicitly create them.

# Allow data pass-through mode for certain hosts when requested by the client
# using a CONNECT request. This is particularly useful to allow access to SSL
# sites (https proxying). The string is a regular expression which should cover
# the server name with port and must be correctly formated and terminated.
# Examples:
# PassThroughPattern: private-ppa\.launchpad\.net:443$
# PassThroughPattern: .* # this would allow CONNECT to everything
#
# Default: ^(bugs\.debian\.org|changelogs\.ubuntu\.com):443$
# PassThroughPattern: ^(bugs\.debian\.org|changelogs\.ubuntu\.com):443$
PassThroughPattern: ^(.*):443$
